# code-quiz
## 👨‍💻 Mission
Create an interactive quiz in JavaScript equipped with highscore tracking and a live timer.

## 🌐 Application
<a href="https://pr1me-e1gh7.github.io/code-quiz/">Link to the App</a>

## 💻 User Experience
Upon loading the homepage, users will be presented with a challenge to encourage them to try the quiz and a start button in the middle of the page, the navbar at the top of the page, and the footer bar at the bottom. The navbar includes links to return to the homepage, a link to the highscores page, and the live timer in the middle. The footer includes a link to my github profile and a link to the project's repo page. When the user clicks on the button to start the game, the quiz will load the questions and respective answers. The user will have 99 seconds to start the quiz, and, each time the user gets a question wrong, they will lose 10 seconds per wrong answer. When they've completed the quiz or run out of time they will be presented with a page to enter in their initials to track their scores. The highscores page includes a button to return to the homepage, as well as a button to reset the scores.
