<p> Upon loading the homepage, users will be presented with a challenge to encourage them to try the quiz and a start button in the middle of the page, the navbar at the top of the page, and the footer bar at the bottom. The navbar includes links to return to the homepage, a link to the highscores page, and the live timer in the middle.
